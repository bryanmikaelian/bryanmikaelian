Backend Engineer

## DESCRIPTION

Backend engineer with over 18 years of experience specializing in billing systems, usage-based infrastructure, and high-scale API development. Expert in architecting payment processing systems, usage data pipelines, and control plane services that handle multiple terabytes of data daily. Proven track record transforming billing architectures and optimizing data pipelines, achieving up to 96% improvement in processing times. Seeking a role with a small, agile team where I can leverage my technical acumen to make immediate impact, with the autonomy to drive decisions and own complex systems end-to-end.

## EXPERIENCE

Implemented observability best practices across the engineering organization through Datadog monitoring improvements and comprehensive runbooks. Mentored four senior engineers who were subsequently promoted to Staff Engineer roles, helping build the next generation of technical leadership. Collaborated directly with the Director and VP of Engineering as well as the CFO to develop and execute strategic billing initiatives aligned with company growth and financial objectives. Effectively managed stakeholders and expectations across multiple customer-facing teams, ensuring seamless billing experiences throughout the customer journey. Core technologies are Ruby and Golang services, Kafka, Clickhouse, and MongoDB.
