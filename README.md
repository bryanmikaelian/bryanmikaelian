### Hi, I'm Bryan ðŸ˜Ž


For my day job, I am a Senior Engineer working at [Aptible](https://www.aptible.com/).

I am usually hacking on something with Clojure or Clojurescript. I am a big fan of networking protocols and obscure RFCs.

My current open source focus:
- [Venn, a self-hosted billing platform](https://github.com/vennbilling/venn)
- [Scrollwork, a AI cost analyzer](https://github.com/vennbilling/scrollwork)

Oh and coffee. Lots of it. â˜•
